                    <div class="collapsible__body">
                        RentBase is a platform built by rental agents to help you qualify and manage 
                        the 3 L’s of your rental business; 
                        Landlords, Listings, and Leads.<br><br>
                        We provide you with desktop and mobile tools, stay on track of all your rental deals and follow ups, and never have a potential deal fall through the cracks again.

                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible__header">How does it work?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible__body">
                        Instead of keeping your contacts and leads in one place, then separately 
                        storing your listings in another place; RentBase is an all-in-one platform 
                        to house (no pun intended) your entire rental business in one place. <br> <br>
                        You can easily import your listings and contacts into RentBase and provide 
                        an easy-to-use database to connect and manage all aspects of your business 
                        (landlords, their listings, and your leads). <br><br>
                        Leads are automatically qualified and filtered into RentBase and matched 
                        with the listings that can best lead to a deal. <br><br>
                        Landlord follow-ups are tracked and updated as soon as you place a call, 
                        text or email them and you can easily create follow-ups and tasks per lead, 
                        listing or landlord.

                        To get our newest updates and apply for access to our Beta product, 
                        enter your email <a href="/">here</a> to request access.<br><br>
                        If you don’t see the email within 2 min it’s 
                        probably stuck in your spam/junk folder.

                        The Beta product is a little taste of what RentBase has to offer. 
                        Instead of chasing down a new lead and trying to connect on the 
                        phone or back and forth in emails, you can provide them your 
                        personalized RentBase link to qualify your leads via their phone or 
                        desktop. <br><br>
                        As soon as a lead completes your form, you’ll receive:<br><br>
                        A text notifying you the lead has completed the form.<br><br>
                        
                        An email with all the answers.<br><br>
                        
                        An excel sheet that will update automatically every time a 
                        lead is added.<br><br>

                        Any real estate agent or property manager who wants to 
                        save time and manage their rental listings and leads 
                        more efficiently. You don’t need to be renting 60+ 
                        apartments to get value from us. Even one good listing 
                        can attract 50-100 unique leads and RentBase can save 
                        you hours of time on them.

                        Right now our Beta is being offered for free. We’d just 
                        like to hear your feedback on it. When we launch in the 
                        Spring we’ll have an early adopter monthly rate of $15 a

                        Yes it does! We know how much agents are on the go and 
                        we’re making RentBase adapt to your needs. Anytime 
                        you’re using it from a desktop, it is updating your 
                        mobile device and vice-versa.

                        We know how important the data you collect or share on 
                        RentBase is to you and we take that VERY seriously. 
                        Our technology has been designed using the most 
                        up-to-date protections and security measures out there. 
                        Our platform’s architect comes from an elite military 
                        software unit and has implemented the same approach to 
                        protecting your information. We do not sell or advertise 
                        your information or your leads data to any 3rd parties, 
                        nor do we share or sell information obtained in RentBase 
                        to users within RentBase.

                    <div class="collapsible__body">
                        No, there’s no limit. As long as you have 1 listing in 
                        the system, you can have 1000 or more. Same goes for 
                        your leads.

                        RentBase can automate the most time consuming and 
                        tedious aspects of your business and free you up to 
                        close more deals and make more money! <br><br>
                        We help you avoid time-wasting leads just as much as 
                        we help you find highly qualified leads. Furthermore 
                        your leads will appreciate this approach that saves 
                        them time as well. We know, we’ve asked and the results 
                        are overwhelming!

                        support your rental business. We know a rental 
                        agent’s needs and the rental-cycle differ greatly 
                        from their sales side.  While there are countless 
                        CRM and lead management products out there, there’s 
                        only one platform built specifically to cover your 
                        A-Z rental business.
